I guess this is the spot where I tell you that I'm into programming/engineering, reading books, climbing, soccer, running, cooking (here and there), chilling with friends and other things so you think I'm some kind of well rounded, interesting person and yadaa yadda. But the truth is everyone has their own self serving interests and these things shouldn't be what makes us special.

What should make us special and is how we relate and get along with each other. The exent to which we can untiringly love our fellow human beings, our ability to treat everyone with dignity and respect, no matter how different their views or backgrounds may be, is what should make us special. Yes, that leaves room for everyone to be special. And that is, honestly, my goal in life, to never let my ego get the best of me. All the things I get involved in are an opportunity for me to defeat my ego, especially programming & athletics, and possibly an opportunity to make a positive impact on the world.
