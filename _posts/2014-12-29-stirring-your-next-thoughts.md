My friend was stirring onions over a period of 5 hours as he was making french onion soup. I came up to him, looked down at the onions in the pot, looked up at him and said, "these onions will, at some point in the future, be a set of thoughts you have". This is true about all that we eat. The meal you consumed earlier today will become the words you speak, the feelings you write, the energy behind emotions such as laughter and distress. Everything we eat will become us in either flesh or energy.

Consume wisely.
